# Automated-Cattle-detection

The intersection of computer vision and agriculture holds immense promise for revolutionizing traditional practices. One such breakthrough is the development of object detection algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once), which enables efficient and accurate identification of objects within images or video frames in real-time. By harnessing the power of deep learning and image processing techniques, we aim to showcase how YOLO can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of cattle monitoring and management, ultimately contributing to the advancement of modern agricultural practices.

Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a viral ailment caused by the LSDV virus, primarily affecting cattle but also buffalo and sheep. The disease causes painful nodules on the skin, reducing productivity and leading to weight loss, and in severe cases, death. 
LSDV is transmitted through blood-sucking organisms, direct contact between animals, and contaminated materials. Prevention involves strict biosecurity measures such as quarantine, insect control, hygiene, and vaccination.

# Result
The implemented cattle monitoring system successfully detects and counts various cattle varieties using YOLO object detection, achieving accurate and real-time identification. Through advanced computer vision techniques, the system analyzes visual cues to identify potential health issues in the detected cattle, providing timely feedback to farmers. This feedback includes notifications indicating the observed health condition and recommendations for necessary medical assistance, contributing to proactive livestock management. The user interface offers intuitive access to monitoring functionalities, displaying comprehensive visualizations of cattle counts, health status, and alerts for critical events. Overall, the system demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing livestock welfare and facilitating informed decision-making for farmers, thereby improving agricultural practices.
